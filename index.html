            <div class="faq-item">
                <button onclick="toggleFAQ('faq1', this)">Q1:  Can an online or private autism diagnosis be accepted by official healthcare systems <span>?</span></button>
                <div id="faq1" class="faq-content">Yes — acceptance depends on the assessor’s credentials and the institution (such as the NHS or local authority) recognizing the diagnostic method. It's important to verify in advance whether the paying institution (e.g. GP, local services) will accept that assessment</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button onclick="toggleFAQ('faq2', this)">Q2: Do online screening tools count as a diagnosis <span>?</span></button>
                <div id="faq2" class="faq-content">No — tools like the AQ‑10 or other online quizzes (e.g. M‑CHAT for toddlers, AQ, SCQ) are screening instruments only. They may indicate whether further evaluation is warranted, but they cannot provide a formal autism diagnosis, which must come from a qualified healthcare professional using standardized diagnostic criteria**</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button onclick="toggleFAQ('faq3', this)">Q3:  At what age can autism be reliably diagnosed <span>?</span></button>
                <div id="faq3" class="faq-content">Autism can be recognized as early as around 12–18 months, although most diagnoses occur by the age of 2–3 years. In adults, a diagnosis is also possible even if signs were previously masked or unrecognized .</div>
